## Response Formats

### Simple Interaction Response
```json
{
  "question": "Your question",
  "reactions": [
    {
      "persona_id": "tech-enthusiast",
      "name": "Tech Enthusiast and Innovation Expert",
      "avatar": "ðŸ¤–",
      "reaction": "AI-generated response",
      "sentiment": "positive",
      "sentiment_score": 3
    }
  ],
  "timestamp": "2024-12-19T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```

}
```

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:
```json
{
  "error": "Descriptive error message"
}
```

HTTP status codes:
- `200`: Success
- `400`: Bad Request (missing required fields)
- `500`: Internal Server Error

## Development

### Adding New Features
1. Update YAML configurations if needed
2. Add new methods to `CrewManager`
3. Create new Flask endpoints
4. Test with Postman or curl

### Debugging
- Enable verbose mode in CrewAI agents for detailed logs
- Check Flask debug output for request/response details
- Monitor Gemini API usage and rate limits

## Production Deployment

### Environment Variables
Set these in your production environment:
```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_production_api_key
FLASK_ENV=production
FLASK_DEBUG=False
```

### Security Considerations
- Keep your Gemini API key secure
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Add authentication for production use
- Monitor API usage and costs

### Scaling
- Consider using Redis for agent caching
- Implement database storage for conversation history
- Add load balancing for multiple instances
- Monitor memory usage with multiple concurrent requests

## Troubleshooting

### API Key Issues
- Verify your Gemini API key is correct
- Check API key permissions and quotas
- Ensure the API key environment variable is set

### Import Errors
- Confirm Python 3.10+ is being used
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Check virtual environment is activated

### Configuration Issues
- Verify YAML files are properly formatted
- Check file paths are correct
- Ensure all required configuration fields are present

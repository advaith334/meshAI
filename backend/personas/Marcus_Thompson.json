    "description": "You're a former restaurant chef who became obsessed with couponing after losing your job during the pandemic. What started as necessity became a competitive sport - you have apps tracking price histories, you know which stores double coupons on Tuesdays, and you once got $200 of groceries for $15. You treat deal-hunting like chess, planning elaborate multi-store shopping trips with military precision. Your garage looks like a small grocery store, but you donate excess to food banks. You're also a craft beer enthusiast who home-brews and can calculate cost-per-ounce instantly. Friends call you the 'Deal Whisperer' and you take genuine pride in helping others save money. You still dream of opening another restaurant someday.",

    "role": "Spontaneous Creative Impulse Buyer",
    "description": "You're a freelance graphic designer who sees inspiration everywhere and acts on it immediately. You have ADHD and get hyperfocused on new creative projects, often buying supplies at 2 AM because you 'need to capture this idea right now.' Your apartment is full of half-finished art projects, vintage cameras you've used once, and craft supplies from phases you went through. You justify purchases by their 'creative potential' and often buy multiple versions of the same thing because you forgot you already had it. Despite the chaos, your impulsive purchases sometimes lead to breakthrough creative work. You're endearingly scattered but genuinely talented.",

    "description": "You're a 34-year-old architect who owns exactly 100 personal items (you keep a numbered list). Every purchase requires something else to be donated or sold. You live in a sparse but beautiful apartment where every object serves multiple purposes and brings you joy. You'll spend months researching the 'perfect' coffee mug and will pay $200 for it because you know it will last decades. You meditate daily, practice calligraphy as a hobby, and believe that constraint breeds creativity. Your friends think you're extreme, but they secretly admire your discipline. You have an encyclopedic knowledge of product design and can explain why every item in your home earned its place. You also volunteer teaching kids about sustainable living.",

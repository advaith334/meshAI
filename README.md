# MeshAI - an simulation of AI Agent Communigyt

An innovative platform that transforms traditional market research. Demo use case focuses on AI-powered focus groups, enabling businesses to gather authentic insights from AI agents with customized personas that simulate real customer behaviors and perspectives.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for MeshAI came from wanting to simulate the human community using Ai agents, or building a community of AI agents, which we believed had such a huge scope of potential application. We decided to zoom in to a very specific use case of focus groups due to the challenges businesses face in conducting traditional focus groups - high costs, scheduling difficulties, limited participant diversity, and geographic constraints. We envisioned a world where companies could instantly access diverse perspectives from AI personas that authentically represent different demographics, psychographics, and behavioral patterns. 

Our vision was to democratize market research by making high-quality consumer insights accessible to businesses of all sizes, from startups to enterprises, while maintaining the authenticity and depth of human feedback through advanced AI simulation.

## What it does

MeshAI is a simulation of AI community. In the prototype use case, it is used for AI-powered focus groups that enables businesses to:

### üé≠ **AI Persona Management**
- Create and customize AI personas with detailed backgrounds, demographics, and behavioral traits
- Choose from 20+ pre-built personas including industry experts, consumer archetypes, and notable figures
- Each persona maintains consistent personality, opinions, and decision-making patterns across sessions

### üó£Ô∏è **Interactive Focus Groups**
- Conduct real-time focus group sessions with multiple AI personas
- Simulate authentic group dynamics with natural conversation flow
- Generate streaming responses that mimic real human interaction patterns

### üìä **Advanced analytics**
- Real-time sentiment analysis of participant responses
- NPS (Net Promoter Score) and CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) metrics
- Comprehensive reporting with insights extraction and trend analysis

### üéØ **Multi-Modal Research**
- Simple Q&A interactions for quick feedback
- Group discussions with dynamic persona interactions
- Structured focus group sessions with defined goals and outcomes

## How we built it

- Creating memory systems to maintain context across interactions

### **2. Real-time AI Response Generation**
Generating authentic, real-time responses from multiple AI agents simultaneously presented performance challenges:
- Optimized LLM API calls with proper rate limiting
- Implemented response caching and streaming
- Built fallback mechanisms for API failures

### **3. Sentiment Analysis Accuracy**
Creating accurate sentiment analysis that captures nuanced emotional responses:
- Developed custom sentiment scoring algorithms
- Integrated multiple AI models for cross-validation
- Fine-tuned analysis parameters for marketing context

### **4. Dependency Management**
Managing complex Python dependencies with LangChain, CrewAI, and Google AI:
- Resolved version conflicts between packages
- Created isolated virtual environments
- Implemented comprehensive error handling

### **5. User Experience Design**
Designing an interface that makes AI-powered focus groups feel natural and intuitive:
- Iterative UI/UX testing and refinement
- Real-time visual feedback for AI responses
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
